# Content Downloader

Downlads content to make your existing OS with [EmulationStation](https://emulationstation.org), __NOT__ [ES-DE](https://es-de.org)

## Installation

Grab the latest release for your system and execute the Installer  

This is `install.sh` for Linux and `installer.exe` for Windows.

These installers will install to your `.emulationstation/CD/` folder.

Due to the installer not knowing what folder is your current theme and for safety when modifying `es_systems.cfg`, you will have to install the theme icons __and__  modify `es_systems.cfg` by yourself.

## Installing the icons

Get the `icons.zip`, and extract it to your current theme pack.

## Modifying `es_systems.cfg`
