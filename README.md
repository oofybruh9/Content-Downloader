# Content Downloader
Downlads content to make your existing OS with [EmulationStation](https://emulationstation.org), __NOT__ [ES-DE](https://es-de.org)

## Installation
Grab the latest release for your system and execute the Installer  

This is `install.sh` for Linux and `Installer.exe` for Windows. 

These installers will install to your `.emulationstation` folder and modify your `es_systems.cfg` to show a new menu called Content Downloader.

Due to the installer not knowing what folder is your current theme, you will have to install the theme icons by yourself.

## Installing the icons
